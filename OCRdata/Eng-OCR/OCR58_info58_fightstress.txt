STRESS LESS ทอเทพเหลดเกร

1. Slow down.
Plan ahead and allow enough time to get the most
important things done without having to rush.

2. Sleep well.

Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. To
fight insomnia, get regular physical and activity during
the day.

3. Let worry go.

The world won't end if a few things fall off your plate.
Give yourself a break and just breathe.

4. Laughit up.
Laughter makes us feel good. Don't be afraid to laugh
out loud, even when you're alone.

5. Get connected.

A daily dose of friendship is great medicine. Make time
to call friends or family so you can catch up.

6. Get organized.
Use “to do” lists to help you focus on your most important
tasks and take big projects one step at atime.

7. Practice giving back.
Volunteer your time or spend time helping a friend.
Helping others helps you.

8. Be active every day.
Exercise can relieve mental and physical tension. Find
something you enjoy and stick with it.

9. Give up the bad habits.

Too much alcohol, tobacco or caffeine can increase
blood pressure. Cut back or quit to decrease anxiety.

10. Lean into things you can change.
Make time to learn a new skill, work toward a goal, or
to love and help others.
