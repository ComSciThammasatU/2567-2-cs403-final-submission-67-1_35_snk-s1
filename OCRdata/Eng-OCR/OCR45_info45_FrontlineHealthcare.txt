HOW TO SUPPORT
FRONTLINE HEALTH RESPONDERS

DONATE MEDICAL SAFETY SUPPLIES TO HELP
WITH SHORTAGES (AND STOP HOARDING)

There is a lack of resources for medical safety supplies (and more) that are

necessary in helping to protect frontline health responders and others from

COVID-19. The community is encouraged to stop panic buying and hoarding
supplies as healthcare facilities are in more dire need

Healthcare workers are risking their lives and require protection for their health.
Each month, the following supplies are needed worldwide by healthcare workers:

๑ 89 MILLION FACE MASKS

Ifyou are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are
taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 infection,
which in this case, is the situation for many healthcare workers
treating patients with symptoms.

In the rise of shortages of face masks, some community
members have been donating fabrics and sewing masks as
alternatives to their local hospitals.

76 MILLION DISPOSABLE GLOVES

The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention)
recommends that frontline healthcare workers wear disposable
gloves when caring for someone who has been diagnosed

with COVID-19, particularly when coming into contact with
bodily fluids.

For the general public who are wearing disposable gloves,
especially if they don’t have a coronavirus patient at home—
experts say this is unnecessary. Donate unused and unopened
boxes of gloves to your local healthcare facility.

2.9 LITRES OF HAND SANITIZER

Many healthcare facilities require hand sanitizer throughout the
entire building for both frontline health responders and patients.
This helps to ensure a more controlled and safely sanitized
environment for everyone.

Again, stop buying supplies in bulk and hoarding! Only use
hand sanitizer when water and soap is not readily available.
Otherwise, practicing a thorough hand washing routine is a
healthy way of preventing the spread of germs.

ORGANIZE FUNDRAISERS OR CAMPAIGNS TO
HELP HEALTHCARE FACILITIES & WORKERS

Whether it is a crowdfunding campaign to
help organize and deliver healthy meals
directly to frontline healthcare workers who
are exhausted from pulling long shifts, or
providing community support to fund mental
health and occupational coping options for

workers—every little bit and effort counts!

For example, some local barista cafes
are offering free coffee to hospital care
workers as a simple gesture to express the
community's gratitude for their dedication
